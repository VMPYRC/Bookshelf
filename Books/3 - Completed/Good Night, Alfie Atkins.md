Oops! He's accidentally spilled the last drop of water on the bed. Or did he spill it on purpose?
```

```
24

Alfie feels like laughing out loud. Daddy looks so funny lying there sleeping. Alfie takes a blanket and tucks it in around Daddy.

"Good night, sleep tight," says Alfie, and he goes to his room. He's thinking that he won't call for Daddy anymore. A daddy who is sleeping can't come running to take care of things. And if no one comes when you call, you might as well be quiet.
