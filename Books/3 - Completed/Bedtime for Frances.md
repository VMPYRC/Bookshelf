"There is a tiger in my room," said Frances.
"Did he bite you?" said Father.
"No," said Frances.
"Did he scratch you?" said Mother.
"No," said Frances.
"Then he is a friendly tiger," said Father.
"He will not hurt you. Go back to sleep."
"Do I have to?" said Frances.
"Yes," said Father.
"Yes," said Mother.

She saw something big and dark.
"Giants are big and dark," she thought.
"Maybe that is a giant.
I think it is a giant.
I think that giant wants to get me."
She went into the living room.

Mother and Father were watching television
and having tea and cake.
Frances said, "There is a giant in my room.
May I watch television?"
"No," said Mother.
"No," said Father.
Frances said, "The giant wants to get me.
May I have some cake?"
Father gave Frances a piece of cake.
Father said, "How do you know he wants to get you?"
Frances said, "Isn't that what giants do?"
Father said, "Not always. Why don't you ask him what he wants?"
Frances went back to her room.

She went right over to the giant.
She said, "What do you want, Giant?"
She took a good look at him.
There was no giant.
It was just the chair and her bathrobe.
So she went to bed again.
