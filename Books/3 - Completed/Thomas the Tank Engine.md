# Quotes

## Thomas and Gordon

```
6

He was a cheeky little engine, too. He thought no engine worked as hard as he did. So he used to play tricks on them. He liked best of all to come quietly beside a big engine dozing on a siding and make him jump.

"Peep, peep, peep, pip, peep! Wake up, lazibones!" he would whistle, "why don't you work hard like me?"

Then he would laugh rudely and run away to find some more coaches.

"Well, little Thomas," chuckled Gordon as he passed, "now you know what hard work means, don't you?"

Poor Thomas couldn't answer, he had no breath. He just puffed slowly away to rest, and had a long, long drink.

He went home very slowly, and was careful afterwards never to be cheeky to Gordon again.

"Why did you come so fast?"

"I didn't mean to, I was pushed," said Thomas sadly.

"Haven't you pulled trucks before?"

"No."

"Then you've a lot to learn about trucks, little Thomas. They are silly things and must be kept in their place."
