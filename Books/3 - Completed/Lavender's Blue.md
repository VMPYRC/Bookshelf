I don't believe you can!
You mustn't laugh,
You mustn't cry,
But do the best you can.

Draw the latch,
Sit by the fire and spin;
Take a cup,
And drink it up,
Then call your neighbours in.

In a shower of rain;

And never went there again.

Solomon Grundy,
Born on a Monday,
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,
Took ill on Thursday,
Worse on Friday,
Died on Saturday,
Buried on Sunday:
That is the end
Of Solomon Grundy.

I had a little pony,
His name was Dapple-grey;

To ride a mile away.
She whipped him and she slashed him,
She rode him through the mire;
I would not lend my pony now
For all that lady's hire.

I'm going a-milking, sir, she said.
May I go with you, my pretty maid?
You're kindly welcome, sir, she said.
What is your father, my pretty maid?
My father's a farmer, sir, she said.
What is your fortune, my pretty maid?
My face is my fortune, sir, she said.
Then I can't marry you, my pretty maid.
Nobody asked you, sir, she said.

Bring forth May flowers

For every evil under the sun
There is a remedy, or there is none,
If there be one, try and find it;
If there be none, never mind it.

Lilies are white,
Rosemary's green.
When you are King,
I will be Queen.

Roses are red,
Lavender's blue.
If you will have me,
I will have you.
